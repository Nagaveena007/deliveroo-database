      "method": "Cut the pumpkin into 3cm / 2.25 slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out (video is helpful). Cut into 4cm / 1.5 chunks. Place the pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth and water in a pot - liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat and let simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender (check with butter knife) - about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth (Note 3 for blender). Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir through cream (never boil soup after adding soup, cream will split).  Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle over a bit of cream, sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!",

      "method": "Bring a pan of water to the boil and season it with salt. Add the spaghetti and stir it gently until all the strands sink beneath the water level. Stir again to make sure they're not stuck together. Cook following the pack instructions but taking 2 mins off the time suggested. Check the pasta when the time is up by biting into a strand – it should be cooked through but still firm. Cook for a further 1-2 mins if you need to, or if you prefer your spaghetti softer. Drain, reserving a little pasta water to add to the sauce. Add the pasta to the sauce straight away so it doesn’t stick together as it cools.",
